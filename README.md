# Iris-Flower-classification
## Introduction

The Iris flower dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 iris flowers, with 50 flowers from each of three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models capable of accurately classifying iris flowers into their respective species based on these measurements.

## Dataset Description

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Number of Instances: 150
Number of Attributes: 4 (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)
Class Distribution: 50 instances per class (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, Iris virginica)
Attribute Information: All attributes are numeric and measured in centimeters.

## Methodology

The following steps were undertaken in this project:

Data Loading and Exploration: The dataset was loaded using the pandas library in Python. Basic descriptive statistics and visualizations were generated to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.
Data Preprocessing: The data was checked for missing values and outliers. Since the dataset is relatively clean, minimal preprocessing was required.
Model selection: To do this project we have used Neural Network Classifier.
Model Training and Evaluation: The dataset was split into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% for training and 20% for testing). Each model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set using metrics such as: Accuracy and loss.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the application of machine learning algorithms for classifying iris flowers based on their physical characteristics. The high accuracy achieved by the models suggests that these methods can be effectively used for similar classification tasks.
